# Introduction
Hurricane Fiona had a devastating effect on Puerto Rican communities. For example, due
to the power and supply chain interruption caused by effects of hurricane flooding, many low-
income families and seniors in cities were unable to maintain a three-day supply of food. This
makes urban communities susceptible for food shortages during and after catastrophic events
such as hurricanes. Urban agriculture can represent an important partner for bolstering
community resilience to natural disasters. One of the major concerns for urban agriculture is soil
contamination with heavy metals and organic legacy contaminants known to be persistent and to
bioaccumulate. However, limited data is available on the extent and distribution of urban soil
contamination in Puerto Rico. In addition, urban farmers have limited information and resources
for assessing levels of contaminants in urban soils and mitigating these toxic chemicals in their
gardens. As the severity of natural disasters increases due to climate change, preservation of
urban soil quality and fertility are important concerns for isolated island communities such as
Puerto Rico that strive for self-sustainability and import independence. As the severity of natural
disasters increases due to climate change, preservation of urban soil quality and fertility are
important concerns for isolated island communities such as Puerto Rico that strive for self-
sustainability and import independence.
Urban soil contaminants. Heavy metals are one of the most concerning chemical
contaminant groups that have a direct negative impact on human and environmental health. Soils
under agricultural and urban land use can have potentially high spatial heterogeneity of
contamination. However, very few studies on the impact of urbanism on soil contamination have
been conducted in tropical regions, particularly in the Caribbean (Dudgeon, 2000; Ramirez et al.
2009). Jirau-Colon et al. (2020) show that the toxic metals associated with industrial activity,
particularly biopharmaceuticals, contribute to the enrichment of the local particle pollution in the
Puerto Rico environment. Ortiz-Colon et al. (2016) found that urban rivers in Puerto Rico had
significantly higher concentrations of As, Ba, Cd, Mg, and Sb as compared with the reference
non-urban river.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are another group of legacy contaminants
that have recently received widespread attention due to their linkage to cancer, liver damage,
immune- and neurotoxicity (Bassler et al. 2019; Mejia-Avendaño et al. 2020). Due to their
highly fluorinated chemical structure, PFAS do not break down easily and can accumulate over
time in the environment and in the human body. Once deposited on soils, heavy metal and PFAS
compounds can be taken up from urban soil by horticultural plants, thus potentially causing
direct impacts and having implications for food chain transmission. However, only few options
are available for urban gardeners to avoid such a transmission and to rehabilitate contaminated
soils. Biochar has recently been proposed as one of the promising and widely accessible
remediation technologies for contaminants in soils (Guo, Song, and Tian 2020).
Biochar, a charcoal product produced by thermal conversion of biomass, is one of the
most affordable negative emission technologies for future large-scale sequestration of carbon
dioxide (Mukome et al. 2013; Tisserant and Cherubini 2019; Lehmann, Gaunt, and Rondon
2006). It is estimated that the biochar market will reach $3.1 billion by 2025 and biochar will
become a major influencing factor in increased crop yield and productivity of the agriculture
sector (Research Report, 2019). The affordability of a local feedstock and the use of biochar
stoves provide the potential for biochar adoption by small farmers (Ippolito, Laird, and Busscher
2012). Due to its unique properties, biochar can be used as a soil amendment for improving soil
quality, increasing drought resilience and crop yields, and reducing soil greenhouse gas
emissions (Tisserant and Cherubini 2019; Sabourin et al. 2009). The high surface area of biochar
(2 - 301.6 m2 g-1) makes it a perfect sorbent for soil remediation and retention of nutrients and
moisture (Sohi et al. 2009; Mukome et al. 2013). For example, it was shown that transport of
pharmaceuticals and heavy metals was significantly reduced in biochar-amended soils (Bair et al.
2016). Addition of biochar to soil was shown to reduce the abundance of antibiotic resistance
genes and it was demonstrated that up to 96% of PFAS concentrations can be removed from soils
by amending the soil with 1% (w:w) of biochar (Chen et al. 2018; Silvani et al. 2019). It was also
noted that so-called designer biochar can be produced to target remediation of specific groups of
chemical contaminants (Silvani et al. 2019).

# Rational and significance
Our goal is to provide strategies and fill information gaps to protect the urban Puerto Rican
communities from food shortage during and after hurricanes through the facilitation of urban
garden development. We aim to promote urban agriculture through educational resources on
strategies to mitigate exposure to soil contamination and conduct research to determine soil
contamination in urban soils in Puerto Rico. Revitalizing urban farming in Puerto Rico by
rehabilitating contaminated soils is a crucial first step on the path toward increasing food security
in countries with high density populations and negative net imports like Puerto Rico. Urban
farming not only boosts sustainable food production in Puerto Rico, but also has a positive socio-
economic effect in the form of community involvement, urban gardener training, and addresses
equity issues in marginalized communities.
In addition to rehabilitating urban soils, the reuse of solid organic wastes in the form of
biochar conserves the embodied energy and supports sustainable food production, which is vital
for sustainability of Puerto Rico's economy and import independence (McLellan et al. 2018). In
fact, based on the recent emergy analysis of Puerto Rico, system sustainability has declined by
84% over the last 54 years since the agricultural-based economy began shifting to industrial
manufacturing (González-Mejía and Ma 2017). As a result of the substantial decline in land use
for agriculture, the island has become dependent on imported food with only 15% of food
produced in Puerto Rico. Decreased production in combination with continual loss of productive
farmland due to land degradation and soil erosion has raised concerns for food security on the
island with nearly 40% of the population in Puerto Rico participating in the federal Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) as compared to ~10% of mainlanders according to USDA.

# Approach
We aim to improve food security after extreme weather events in Puerto Rico by promoting
urban agriculture through educational resources and conducting research to mitigate exposure to
soil contaminants in urban soils. Our hypothesis is that agronomic use of biochar will provide a
critical and accessible solution for rehabilitation of impacted soils.
Three specific objectives will be addressed in the presented study:
 - Objective 1 Promote home/community gardens and small scale agriculture in urban settings through creation of information hub and trainings
 - Objective 2: Develop safe farming practices based on contaminant mitigation studies
 - Objective 3: Rate the capacity of biochar for contaminated soil rehabilitation

As an output from the project, we anticipate producing scientifically-based guidelines for
urban agriculture on the use of biochar to support crop production in hurricane affected soils.
Short-term deliverables (within 3 months of award receipt) will include urban garden trainings,
initiation of second year Master Gardener program, and development of specific biochar
application strategies for contaminant exposure mitigation in urban gardens. We will also create
online resources for information sharing and provide networking opportunities to support local
urban gardeners affected by the hurricane. The increased soil quality and crop yields can
alleviate food insecurity on the island. In addition, the results and outcomes of the project can be
broadly useful for other regions, as many nations in the near future will be faced with challenges
to sustain exponentially growing populations with limited food, water, and land resources
subjected to changing climatic conditions.
The proposed project aligns with USDA Strategic Goal 5: Strengthen the Stewardship of
Private Lands Through Technology and Research and Goal 7: Provide All Americans Access to a
Safe, Nutritious, and Secure Food Supply. The project addresses USDA Science Blueprint
Program Theme 1: Sustainable Ag Intensification by adoption of new technology and innovative
practices while reducing environmental impacts.
Objective 1: Promote home gardens, community gardens, and small scale agriculture in urban
settings
First, we will organize information already existing on the subject in a user-friendly form
that is easily accessible and utilizable for urban gardeners. Currently the information on urban
gardening related issues in Puerto Rico is sparse and not well organized. This limits its usability
and wide application. We will catalog and organize the available UPR extension notes, workshop
materials, and other documents and create an information hub. This will not only support urban
gardeners and farmers, but also promote networking and information exchange. The information
will include topics such as sustainable urban agriculture management, vegetable production in
new agricultural sites in Puerto Rico, causes of soil contamination and remediation techniques,
urban soil assessments, and marketing techniques for food production systems. In addition, based
on the collected information, we will identify information gaps and produce technical notes to
address these topics.
To reach the greatest number of families in the shortest amount of time we will work with
the Master Gardeners and 4-H programs in Puerto Rico to assist in the teaching and the
implementation of urban gardens. The Master Gardener program in Puerto Rico completed its
first year in early 2020 before the pandemic shut down activities across the island. Twenty-five
participants completed the 12-module program but due to the pandemic the participants have had
limited opportunities to provide service hours and the program has since languished. To increase
volunteer help in the implementation of urban home gardens, the Second Masters Gardeners
training will be held early in the project year. The previous graduates of the Masters Gardeners
program will be incorporated in the execution of this second year. As graduates of the program,
the master gardeners will be able to instruct community groups and school kids on gardening
topics, while also helping the Agriculture Extension Service in its efforts to educate the general
public about safe and correct gardening for non-commercial agricultural practices. The
involvement of the Master Gardeners and the Master Gardener program in Puerto Rico will
allow for urban garden instruction and implementation to increase food security in extreme
weather events to perpetuate into the future long after this project concludes.
As families with young children and seniors are at greatest risk for lack of food after a
hurricane, home garden instruction will be focused on 4-H groups across the island. 4-H
members will be encouraged to invite their families and friends to the training in their area. 4-H
members will be included in the organization and where appropriate lesson instruction during the
training. We will work closely with leaders and professionals in the Youth and 4-H Club
Development Program by integrating educational materials for the existing program. Lessons
and lesson material will be tailored to the audience and will provide various gardening options
appropriate for distinct living situations. Agricultural agents from the Agricultural Extension
Service will assist in promotion and logistics (location, time, setup, etc.) of the trainings.
Participants of the urban garden training will be provided with a starter gardening kit with
selected materials to encourage the implementation of the home garden. These materials will
include seeds, potting soil, starter fertilizer, biochar, 6-pack seedling containers or 4 inch pots,
and small hand shovels.
In addition to the urban garden trainings, we will work closely with small farmers and
community gardens in urban settings with extension specialists in these areas to help develop
impactful extension materials. The use of field days or tours at the agricultural experiment
stations to demonstrate site-specific management techniques behind the use of biochar
amendments will be a perfect application of these tools.
Field demonstration plots will be coordinated by extension specialists and educators at
the (a) Gurabo and Juana Diaz Experimental Stations (see Objective 2 for field plot description)
and (b) a demonstration garden located in the Mayaguez area that is easily accessible for the
general public. These specific field plot sites will be established to ensure hands-on experiences
and adoption of best management practices (BMP) behind the use of biochar and its benefits to
soil and plant health. Vegetables will be grown on each of these field demonstration plots
including (lettuce, tomato, sweet chili peppers and other specialty vegetables). During the
establishment of these field plots, field day tours will be coordinated by the extension specialist
and educator including guided sampling activities, and application demonstrations. In addition,
seminars featuring farmer panels, and project presentations will be given. Participant surveys to
assess knowledge about biochar and mature compost use in agriculture will be conducted prior to
and after each field day.
A series of factsheets and eLearning videos will be generated to demonstrate the BMP of
biochar application, and educational printed material will also be published. All materials will be
posted on the UPRM extension website and social media accounts (https://www.uprm.edu/sea/).
Videos will be uploaded for accessibility for the general public at the Extension UPRM YouTube
channel. Access to website and video viewings will be tracked and reported to address
accessibility and outreach. To facilitate the search and accessibility of the materials these will be
also posted through the vegetable and basic grain industry website
(https://www.uprm.edu/hortalizasygranosbasicos/) and media accounts. All materials will be
accessible in bilingual (English and Spanish) and shared across the states and territories.
Objective 2: Develop safe farming practices based on contaminant mitigation studies
Field plot demonstration trials will be carried out at two sites (Agricultural Experimental
Station Gurabo and Juana Diaz) to develop region specific farming practices that can be
implemented by urban growers. Both sites are located near the largest metropolitan areas in
Puerto Rico. The Gurabo Agricultural Experimental Station is located on the northern coast of
the island near San Juan, the capital and the largest city of Puerto Rico. The average precipitation
in Gurabo is 67 inches per year. Due to the above average wet conditions in Gurabo, the
proponents have included a budget for the purchase of a medium height tunnel. The structure
will serve as an example of the alternatives the participants have when living in areas of constant
or heavy rains. The Juana Diaz Agricultural Experiment Station is located on the south coast of
the island near Ponce which is Puerto Rico’s second largest city, with an average precipitation of
32 inches per year. The field plots will be designed to reflect the common practice in urban
agriculture of row planting. Specialty vegetables such as lettuce, tomato, sweet chili peppers will
be grown. Biochar will be applied at three representative rates within the recommended ranges
from the biochar manufacturer (1-100 t/ha). Plots with no biochar will be included for each crop
to serve as a control treatment. Prior to the application, biochar will be analyzed for PFAS and
heavy metals and subjected to the germination test. Organic fertilizer or compost will be added at
an agronomic rate to fulfill crop nutrient requirements for specific horticultural crops.
Soil at two field sites will be analyzed 1) prior to the biochar application, 2) prior to
planting, and 3) after harvest. Samples will be analyzed for chemical and physical parameters
such as pH, available P, organic matter content, exchangeable cations (Ca2+, K+
, Mg2+),
micronutrient content, soil texture, structure and aggregate stability (Cambardella and Elliott,
1992). Additional samples will be sent out to the contract laboratory for soil health specific
analysis such as the Haney soil health test. Changes in measured dynamic soil properties will be
incorporated in soil health indices that will be used to rank the application rates according to
their efficacy for each tested crop. Soil from both fields will be analyzed for background
concentrations of PFAS and heavy metals prior to the start of the field trial.
During the growth season, plant health will be monitored by recording plant emergence
(direct seeded crops) and plant transplanting percentage (transplanted crops), plant growth and
development. Diseases and pests pressure will be monitored throughout the growing season in
order to protect economic yield and reflect standard BMPs.
Upon manual harvesting, plants will be evaluated for a range of properties to reflect the
effect of biochar on plant health and crop performance. Marketable fruits (or edible part) number
and weight will be recorded for each treatment. Plant height, number of shoots, and individual
flowers or clusters (Cucurbits or Solanaceae crops) will be recorded for each plant to reflect the
overall plant health. Chlorophyll content will be measured to reflect changes induced by soil
salinity. Contents of plant nutrients (N, F, K, Ca, Mg, Zi, B, Fe) will be measured for a
composite plant sample for each treatment. Data for nutrient content and crop quality at the two
experimental sites, and biochar application rates will be analyzed, and any correlation will be
assessed.
Objective 3: Rate the capacity of biochar for contaminated soil rehabilitation
Biochar locally produced from a range of feedstocks including coffee shrubs, coconut,
and other wood biomass using a kiln will be rated based on their capacity to mitigate
contaminants in soils using a batch soil sorption experiment. The effect of biochar on PFAS
(PFOS and PFOA) and heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Li, Ni, Sb) sorption on two soils representative
of the Puerto Rico urban area (San Anton and Montegrande soil series) will be assessed. Sorption
batch experiments will be conducted for individual contaminants as well as a mixture of
contaminants to account for synergistic effects and possible competition for sorption sites on
biochar and soils. Briefly, 5 g of air-dried and sieved soil will be equilibrated with 40 mL of
aqueous contaminants. Solution at an initial concentration in the range of 0.005 to 1.25 mmol L-1
(Popova and Morra 2017). Soils will be equilibrated for 24-48 h at room temperature in the dark.
Biochar will be added at five ratios to simulate the field application rates recommended by the
biochar manufacturer. Soil-water distribution coefficients (KD) will be calculated as a ratio of
contaminants concentrations in solid phase to the respective solute concentrations.
Concentrations of heavy metals will be analyzed using Bruker S1 Titan 600 portable X-
ray fluorescence spectrometry (pXRF). Concentrations of PFAS compounds will be analyzed
according to US EPA 537.1 or US EPA 8327 (Parry and Anumol 2019). An Agilent 1290 HPLC
6230 TOF MS system equipped with a Zorbax XDB-C18 (50×4.6 mm, 1.8 μm) will be used for
identification and quantification of PFAS. PFAS will be quantified in negative ESI mode using
the pseudomolecular ion. Since PFAS are ubiquitous contaminants, all laboratory glass will be
tested before first use by washing with acetonitrile, concentrating, and analyzing it. To prevent
potential PFAS contaminations from mobile phase, a delay column (Agilent InfinityLab PFC)
will be installed on the HPLC pump.
The reversibility of contaminants’ sorption on soils will be measured by desorbing them
from soils with a discrete volume of water to simulate the water regime. Desorption will be
expressed in terms of desorption coefficients (K-D). Sorption and desorption isotherms will be
fitted with linear, Freundlich, or Langmuir models based on the sorption type observed (Bair et
al. 2016). The discrepancy in sorption and desorption isotherms will be indicative of
nonsingularity of sorption and will be described in terms of hysteresis indexes based on Huang
and Weber’s method (Huang, Yu, and Weber 1998).
Based on the data obtained, locally available biochars will be rated based on their
capacity to sorb contaminants at the specific range of concentrations in different soil. This
information will be added to the information website developed under Objective 1 to provide
urban gardeners with a specific selection tool for biochars.
# Milestones and Assessment
We will use the attached logic model to assess progress and accomplishments throughout
the project. Quarterly progress assessments will be documented internally. Milestones will
include: developing and publishing of extension outputs that assist in the understanding and
implementation of urban gardening; publish manuscript(s) focused on the use of biochar to
mitigate contaminant exposure in urban gardens programs, and prospects for reduction of urban
soil contamination; outreach events (Youth and 4-H Club program, Master Gardener program
trainings, demonstration plot tours, etc.) to disseminate information on on-hands practices and
potential issues in urban gardening as well as promotion of urban gardening. The assessment of
involvement will be based on the participation and adoption of methods and techniques in urban
gardening and farming by the local community. Analytics for the developed online resources will
be collected to assess the usage. In addition, a search engine optimization score and backlinking
will be documented to estimate the citation of information. Evaluation questionnaires will be
used at the conclusion of each training to assess the participants’ learning outcomes and their
intentions to use the skills and knowledge gained. The training will include opportunities for the
participants to reflect on what they learned and form a plan on how they will implement a home
garden appropriate for their living situation. We will conduct a survey of the training attendees 3
months after they receive the training to determine 1) if they have established their home garden,
2) identify the major roadblocks that affected implementation, and 3) assess what additional
information and support is needed.
