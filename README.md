# Urban Grow

This is the repository for Urban Grow. We host the site here!

It uses the [Spells](https://github.com/abby-1b/Spells) compiler, so it has two
separate directories: `src` contains the source code (mostly `css`, `spl`, and
`ts` files), while `site` contains the compiled site (which is what you see!)

Everything else here is just extra tooling to make compiling the site easier.

## What's the difference between this and `urbangrowpr.com`?

The website is hosted by GitHub, and [urbangrowpr.com](https://urbangrowpr.com)
is the way that it's accessed. You _could_ also access it through the link
[urban-grow.github.io](https://urban-grow.github.io), but that would be
unprofessional.
